# Install good editors

[Spyder] or [VSCode] are two good open-source editors (IDE). Spyder is specialized on
Python and more oriented on scientific programming. VSCode is more generalist and
lightweight.

[Jupyterlab] is another program that can be used to develop software and notebooks.
Jupyter can be used online but it is also very convenient to be able to install it and
launch it locally.

It is good if you are able to use these different tools in the situations they are the
most adapted. Finally, you will choose you preferred tools but in practice, it is good to
be able to install and manage these software on different computers.
