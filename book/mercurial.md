# How to Mercurial

[Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) is a free, distributed source control
management tool. It's is a great tool and if you are doing research (coding and/or
writing papers), you should use a version control software! It seems to me that Mercurial
is a good solution for researchers (in particular it is
[in my opinion](http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/people/Pierre.Augier/mercurial-as-a-great-version-source-control-management-tool-in-academics.html)
simpler and nicer to learn and use than
[Git](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/GitConcepts)).

Mercurial couples very well with the programs
[TortoiseHG](https://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/) and [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) (if you
can, just install them, especially Meld).

There are a lot of tutorials and documentations about Mercurial (for example
[the official Mercurial tutorial](https://wiki.mercurial-scm.org/Tutorial)).
In this page, I focus on what is needed to develop FluidDyn packages and
projects hosted on Github or Gitlab.

[Heptapod](https://heptapod.net/) is a friendly fork of GitLab Community Edition
supporting Mercurial.
